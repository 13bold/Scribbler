Scribbler
=========
Scribbler is a Cocoa framework for Last.fm by {13bold}. Drawing on inspiration from (the failure of) the `LFScrobbler` framework, Scribbler aims to solve many of the connectivity and stability issues exhibited by the old framework, while adding new features, like the ability to Love and Ban tracks.

Scribbler **IS NOT** backwards-compatible with `LFScrobbler`.
