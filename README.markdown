Last.fm.framework
=================
`Last.fm.framework` is a Cocoa framework for Last.fm by {13bold}. Drawing on inspiration from (the failure of) the `LFScrobbler` framework, `Last.fm.framework` aims to solve many of the connectivity and stability issues exhibited by the old framework, while adding new features, like the ability to Love and Ban tracks.

`Last.fm.framework` **IS NOT** backwards-compatible with `LFScrobbler`.
